## what is transform: scale() property and function in CSS?
- The transform property in CSS is used to apply transformations to an element.
- The scale() function takes two values: one for the horizontal axis (X) and one for the vertical axis (Y).

scale(1, -1): it means that the element will be scaled to its original size along the X-axis (horizontal) and flipped vertically along the Y-axis. Specifically, the value -1 in the Y-axis means that the element will be inverted vertically, creating a reflection or a mirror effect.
