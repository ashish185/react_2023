## ARIA
- Accessible Rich Internet Applications.
- Form: Labels
  - aria-label
  - aria-labelledby
  - arid-describedby: Description of label in some other field not in label.
  - aria-live: used for notification

## Basic Examples
  1. aria-label
       - Use case: Suppose there's magnifying_glass photo as icon button but there's no name of button,
         so here aria-label can be useful.
       ```HTML
       <button aria-label="Search">
          <img src="magnifying_glass.png" alt="Search Icon">
       </button>
       ```
  2. aria-labelledby
       - Use case: Suppose you want to associate a div with label.
       ``` HTML
        <label id="emailLabel">Email:</label>
        <div type="email" aria-labelledby="emailLabel">
       ```
  3. aria-describedby
         - Use case: when you need to provide additional descriptive information about an element
       ``` HTML
          <label for="password">Password:</label>
          <input type="password" id="password" aria-describedby="passwordHint">
          <div id="passwordHint">Password must be at least 8 characters long and contain a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters.</div>

       ```

## Role | Properties | State
